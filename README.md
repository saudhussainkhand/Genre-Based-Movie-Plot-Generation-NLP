# Genre-Based-Movie-Plot-Generation-NLP
Fine tuned GPT-2, DistilGPT, GPT-Neo, T5, BART for Genre based movie plot generation

## Abstract
The project ”Genre-Based Movie Plot Generation Using Text Generation Models” explores the exciting field of natural language process- ing and machine learning to generate movie plots based on different genres. The goal of the project is to leverage text generation models to automatically generate unique and engag- ing movie plots that align with specific genres, such as action, romance, comedy, or science fiction. To achieve this, the project utilizes state-of-the-art text generation models, such as GPT-2, Distill-GPT, GPT-NEO, BART and T5 Models. All of the models were fined tuned on wikimovies dataset. Furthermore the gen- erated stores were evaluated using Self-BLEU score.

## Generated Plots Example (Fine Tuned GPT2)
Input Prompt: BOS superhero Batman.
Plot generated: Batman is hired by a crime boss named Zoltan to steal the Mask of Lib- erty, the mask which transforms him into an enormous cat-like figure. When his hench- men kidnap Ramona and demand it back with them in exchange for their help freeing her father from prison (which he had earlier tried), Batman intervenes on behalf both sides.
